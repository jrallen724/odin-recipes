    <h1>Stovetop Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
        <p>Fast and easy macaroni and cheese made right on the stove with a single pot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>8 oz macaroni</li>
            <li>4 oz American cheese</li>
            <li>4oz extra shard cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>

            <li>
                Bring water and milk to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Stir in macaroni and 
                reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until macaroni is soft 
                (slightly past al dente), 6 to 8 minutes. Add American cheese, mustard, and cayenne 
                and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. 
                Off heat, stir in cheddar until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan 
                and let stand for 5 minutes.

                Meanwhile, combine panko, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in 8-inch 
                nonstick skillet until panko is evenly moistened. Cook over medium heat, stirring 
                frequently, until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle Parmesan over 
                panko mixture and stir to combine. Transfer panko mixture to small bowl.
            </li>

                Stir macaroni until sauce is smooth (sauce may look loose but will thicken as it 
                cools). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to warm serving dish and 
                sprinkle panko mixture over top. Serve immediately.
